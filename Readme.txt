Assignment: Build a functional Web Server
Date of submission: 02-08-2017

High level description of assignment and what this program does:

* This program is a simple HTTP webserver which accepts HTTP requests and responds accordingly
* The application is multithreaded so once the connection is accepted, it will spawn a new thread to handle the request.
* images of type jpeg/jpg, gif and files of type txt/ html is supported

Brief explanation about the program:
- server_socket is an object of ServerSocket class that takes port number as command line argument. It listens for incoming connections
- Inside while loop we infinetly wait for TCP connection
  - A Socket object con_socket is created to that waits for incoming client 
  - An object(req) is created to process HTTP request message
  - A thread is created to process each request and is started
- each request is handled in handleRequest() method of HttpRequest class that implements Runnable interface
- in handleRequest() method, we get reference for socket input and output streams
- we take the inital request line of the HTTP request message and extract the filename, which is then parsed and type of content is determined
- the requested resource is written to a buffer and displayed and connection is closed

- Http 404,403,200 are handled
- for Http 400 error also 404 is returned
